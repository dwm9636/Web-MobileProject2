                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    In modern times, a web browser is something most people take for granted. A vast majority of Windows users are on 
                    Google Chrome and those on Mac and IOS use the built in Safari browser, but browsers weren’t around since the very 
                    beginning and there weren’t always clear champions of the space link there are today. 
                </p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1991, WorldWideWeb was released on neXTstep as the world’s first web browser. In the next few years, 
                    many web browsers were released for different platforms, but none was more influential than Mosaic. It was both more 
                    powerful and had more features than its competition, which resulted in it holding 55 percent of user share by 1995, 
                    just 2 years after its release. After graduation, one of the developers of Mosaic, Marc Andreessen, went on to found 
                    a company that would later be known as Netscape Navigator. The two browsers were great competition for each other and, 
                    as the web boom set by the end of 1995, the first Browser War began.
                </p>
                <h3>The First Browser War</h3>
                <p>
                    Netscape Navigator saw extreme success due to its free distribution among non-commercial users and launched with a 
                    fantastic IPO. It triumphed over Mosaic. This success garnered the attention of Microsoft, who spoke with Netscape 
                    about the future of the web and made an offer to purchase the browser. This however, did not go well for Microsoft 
                    and as a result they began development of Internet Explorer. Version 1 was rather unimpressive, but when version 2 was 
                    launched on December 7th of 1995, the potential of the browser became clear. The two companies fought viciously for 
                    user share, making small improvements often and bringing huge changes to try and swing the war in their favor. 
                    This brought along javascript support, CSS, and applets, but the biggest hit came in with Internet Explorer 4.0. 
                    This was revolutionary because it integrated Explorer directly into Windows. Users no longer had to get the browser 
                    separately. It came preinstalled with their operating system. This was the start of the downfall of Netscape Navigator, 
                    who never recovered. The first Browser War ended in 2001 when Internet Explorer held a staggering 96% market share.
                </p>
                <h3>The Second Browser War</h3>
                <p>
                    With the fall of Netscpe Navigator, Internet explorer became the sole dominant force in the world of browsers. 
                    This led Microsoft to become complacent and stop pushing out frequent and substantial updates. Technology was advancing, 
                    but IE was not keeping up to date. In 2004, Netscape open sourced their code and founded the Mozilla Foundation to create 
                    a successor to their browser, and thus the second browser war began. Mozilla’s Firefox came in swinging with phishing filters,
                     full support for PNGs, and tabbed browsing. At a similar time, the Opera browser was released with similar features and 
                     Microsoft ws rushing to play catch-up until Internet Explorer 7.0 was released. By 2009, Fiefox and Opera were far out 
                     performing IE and the market share reflected that, but another company was about to enter the fight for dominance, Google. 
                     With an already existing monopoly in the search engine market, they launched Google Chrome near the end of 2008 with the 
                     brand new V8 javascript engine. Google took on an approach similar to that of the first browser war where they released 
                     frequent impactful updates and other browsers couldn’t keep up. By 2016, Microsoft discontinued new development for Internet 
                     Explorer, but kept support until the release of Edge in 2022. Opera had no serious impact on the end of the second browser 
                     war and in 2017, Mozila’s CTO stated that Google Chrome had won the second browser war. Today, Google Chrome holds over 70 
                     percent of the browser user share and remains the dominant force in both browsers and search engines.
