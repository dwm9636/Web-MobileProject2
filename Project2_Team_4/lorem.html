                <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is a sample text used in the printing and typesetting industries. It has been used since 
                    the times of the printing press. Not only has it been used for 500 years but it is also used not only
                    for print but also for web pages and other forms of digital media.

                <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
                <p>
                    Although it looks like random letters to modern readers, Lorem Ipsum comes from classical latin. More specifically
                    form a text written in 45 B.C. by Cicero called "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil).
                    The original Lorem Ipsum text was pulled from section  1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of the text. If you are curious as to 
                    what Lorem Ipsum actually says you can read a translated version of Cicero's original work.
                </p>

                <h3>The Passage Lorem Ipsum was Based on</h3>
                <p>
                    "Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, 
                    eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam 
                    voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem 
                    sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non
                    numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum 
                    exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure 
                    reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?"
                </p>

                <h3>The Translation</h3>
                <p>
                    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born 
                    and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer 
                    of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
                    because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
                    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain 
                    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
                    procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical 
                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses 
                    to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant 
                    pleasure?"
